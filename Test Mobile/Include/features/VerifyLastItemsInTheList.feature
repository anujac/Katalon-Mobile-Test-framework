Feature: Verify last item in the List
  As a user, 
  I want to scroll to the end of the screen, 
  So that I can interact with the last item in the list.


  Scenario: Title of your scenario outline
    Given that I have started the android application
    And I navigate the application to Graphics form
    When I scroll to "Xfermodes" text
    Then the current screen should show "Xfermodes" text after scrolling
